# TB3: text-based Scratch 3

[TB3 (currently in beta)](https://mxmou.github.io/scratch-gui/tb3/) replaces Scratch's block area with a code editor based on [tosh](https://tosh.blob.codes/). Because it's a Scratch mod, it still includes many Scratch features that text-based languages typically don't have, such as a costume and sound editor. The syntax is mostly the same as in tosh (see the [guide](https://tosh.blob.codes/help/guide/)).

**Important: opening existing Scratch projects in TB3 isn't supported yet.** (But projects made using TB3 can be opened in Scratch.)

Source code can be found in:
* this repo (the interesting parts are in `src/lib/tosh` and `src/lib/code-editor`)
* https://github.com/mxmou/scratch-vm/tree/tb3
* https://github.com/mxmou/scratch-paint/tree/tb3

Bug reports and feature requests can be made in this repo's Issues tab or on the [forum topic](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/796834/).
